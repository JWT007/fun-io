/**
 * Decorates input and output stream {@linkplain Socket sockets} in order to transform the transmitted content.
 * <p>
 * With an encryption filter for example, the {@link #apply} method would decorate the loaned output streams
 * with a new {@link javax.crypto.CipherOutputStream} in order to encrypt the data before writing it to the underlying
 * output stream.
 * Likewise, the {@link #unapply} method would decorate the loaned input streams with a new
 * {@link javax.crypto.CipherInputStream} in order to decrypt the data after reading it from the underlying input
 * stream.
 * <p>
 * As another example, with a compression filter the {@code apply} method would decorate the loaned output
 * streams with a new {@link java.util.zip.DeflaterOutputStream} in order to compress the data before writing it to the
 * underlying output stream.
 * Likewise, the {@code unapply} method would decorate the loaned input streams with a new
 * {@link java.util.zip.InflaterInputStream} in order to decompress the data after reading it from the underlying input
 * stream.
 * <p>
 * The benefit of this interface is that you can easily chain the {@code apply} and {@code unapply} methods in order to
 * from rich decorators without needing to know anything about the implementation of the filters.
 * <p>
 * For example, depending on the previous examples, the following test code would assert the round-trip processing of
 * the string {@code "Hello world!"} using the composition of some compression and encryption filters on
 * some store:
 * <pre>{@code
 * Filter compression = ...;
 * Filter encryption = ...;
 * Store store = ...;
 * Socket<OutputStream> compressAndEncryptData = compression.apply(encryption.apply(store.output()));
 * Socket<InputStream> decryptAndDecompressData = compression.unapply(encryption.unapply(store.input()));
 * compressAndEncryptData.map(PrintWriter::new).accept(writer -> writer.println("Hello world!"));
 * decryptAndDecompressData.map(InputStreamReader::new).map(BufferedReader::new).accept(reader ->
 *     assertTrue("Hello world!".equals(reader.readLine())));
 * }</pre>
